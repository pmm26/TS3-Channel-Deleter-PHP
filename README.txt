#Updated

The Channeldeleter is a tool to check the activity of Channel on a TeamSpeak Server. 
This Script will add Bin Icons to unused channels in your teamspeak server. 

It requires you to have a mysql server and run this script in X time using cron.

The delete channel script included in the original TS-N Version has been removed since I do not use it an do not which to support it but if you get the original files it should still work.
